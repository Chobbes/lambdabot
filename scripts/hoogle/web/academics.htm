<h2>Sponsorship</h2>

<p>
	The main author is a PhD student supported by a studentship from the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council of the UK.

<h2>Related Work</h2>

<p>
	A lot of related work was done by Rittri [1] and Runciman [2] in the late 80's. Since then Di Cosmo [3] has produced a book on type isomorphisms, which is also related. Unfortunately the implementations that accompanied the earlier works were for functional languages that have since become less popular, and to my knowledge no existing functional programming language has a tool such as Hoogle.
