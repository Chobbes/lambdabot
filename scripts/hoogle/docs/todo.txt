Tidy up the parser
  Remove conflicts
  Fix the 2 unused rules
  Check the output of curried functions is correct
  Parse errors "a[", should give an error message


Sort out the proper probabilities

Allow functions to be matched partially

Allow function argument reordering

If no results are returned, state that, instead of no output

I think the unification is wrong in some cases

Class information, i.e. which types belong to which classes
