Dons:

  - count number of commands/plugins

  - a dynamic Config.hs module.
  - a scripting interface, expose module ops to a scripting module
  - look at pinging the server

  - things that should work:
        pl     . djinn
        type   . djinn $ xs == xs
        pretty . djinn
        pretty . pl
        djinn . hoogle

Todo:
    * Better error reporting when connections fail at startup
    * fsbot-style factoid parsing, 
    * real hostmask matching
    * refactor utility functions out of the modules ex. gets(\s -> lookupFM ...)
    * @fact-to ircnick key for sending factoids via privmsg
    * multiple servers
    * factor out an IRC library
    * send alternate nickname?
    * automatically filter out blanks lines, ie. in dictionary output

Wishlist:

    * search ghc haddocks by function name and type name and ghc command line option searching ;-)
    * search Haskell 98 report
    * search citeseer
    * search local database of researching paper by keyword (swish++ ?)
    * channel statistics, record of pasted urls
    * unit tests, quickcheck tests, written tests... ok, maybe not written
    * Some support for bot clients to be able to do their own request/response stuff

* add your wishes here ...
