Dons:
  - a dynamic Config.hs module.
  - a scripting interface, expose module ops to a scripting module
  - look at pinging the server
 - plugin for `lambdaShell'

 - things that should work:
        pl     . djinn
        type   . djinn $ xs == xs
        pretty . djinn
        pretty . pl
        djinn . hoogle

Todo:
* Better error reporting when connections fail at startup
* FactModule - make "foo?" equal to "lambdabot: @fact foo"
* fsbot-style factoid parsing, 
* real hostmask matching
* refactor utility functions out of the modules ex. gets(\s -> lookupFM ...)
* @fact-to ircnick key for sending factoids via privmsg
* reformat/refill output to allow for fewer longer lines.
* multiple servers
* factor out an IRC library
* update the README
* send alternate nickname?
* automatically filter out blanks lines, ie. in dictionary output

2.0 release list:
* @more needs to check for really really long lines

Wishlist:

* search ghc haddocks by function name and type name and ghc command line option searching ;-)
* search Haskell 98 report
* search citeseer
* search local database of researching paper by keyword (swish++ ?)
* search haskell-wiki
* channel statistics, logs, record of pasted urls
* unit tests, quickcheck tests, written tests... ok, maybe not written
* Some support for bot clients to be able to do their own request/response stuff

* add your wishes here ...
