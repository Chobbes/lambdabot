----------------------------------------------------------------------------
This document describes various style recommendations for the lambdabot
code. Yet, the source code does not respect this document, but it is the
goal that it should eventually. Therefore, you are encouraged to change
source code such that it fits the style inside this document.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

*** Placement of $Id .. $ tags

$Id .. $ tags should be placed right before the module keyword like this:
{{{
--      $Id: QuoteModule.hs,v 1.1 2003/07/29 13:41:48 eleganesh Exp $

module QuoteModule where
}}}

*** Order of imports

Imports should be ordered as so:
{{{
        Local application
        Local application qualified/as

        Old-style Haskell2 modules
        Data.*
        Control.*
        System.*

        GHC.*
}}}

*** Don't use Haskell2 modules

Haskell2 module imports should be replaced with their hierachial module
counterpart. For instance, the List module should be replaced with
Data.List.

*** Don't use deprecated modules

Modules deprecated should be removed and replaced with their no-deprecated
counterparts. This is especially important to avoid bitrot in the code.

*** Minimalize namespace

Try to minimalize the namespace. Only import what you are going to use and
use qualified imports to keep the module namespace simple.
