Don's Todo:
* get rid of deprecations
* @uptime
* partition core and plugins.
* hs-plugins
* make @karma persistent

Todo:
* FactModule - make "foo?" equal to "lambdabot: @fact foo"
* fsbot-style factoid parsing, 
* ircPrivmsg should actually be an input collector of some type, that way output filters could be written
* switch to using Arrows as much as possible
* real hostmask matching
* move privileged commands out of @listcommands
* refactor utility functions out of the modules ex. gets(\s -> lookupFM ...)
* change @more and 'no self privmsg' to output plugins/filters
* @fact-to ircnick key for sending factoids via privmsg
* reformat/refill output to allow for fewer longer lines.
* multiple servers
* factor out an IRC library
* delYsid suggested holding all per-module state in a tuple, thereby skipping the Typeable problem
* update the README
* send alternate nickname?
* automatically filter out blanks lines, ie. in dictionary output
* Fix babel not to bring lambdabot down when the proxy doesn't resolve

2.0 release list:
* @more needs to check for really really long lines

Wishlist:

* search google
* search ghc haddocks by function name and type name and ghc command line option searching ;-)
* search Haskell 98 report
* search citeseer
* search local database of researching paper by keyword (swish++ ?)
* search haskell-wiki
* channel statistics, logs, record of pasted urls
* unit tests, quickcheck tests, written tests... ok, maybe not written
* Some support for bot clients to be able to do their own request/response stuff

* add your wishes here ...

Profiling issues:

* ln -s Map.o Map.p_o
* dynloading won't work, as it requires prof versions of
  HSfoo.o, which don't exist usually. So turn off dyn loading,
  and link everything statically.
