Known bugs and silliness:
* Currently, the Type module sends qualified imports to ghci
  which doesn't know what to do with them, and spits out errors.
  This is currently harmless, but bad.
* L.hs gets copied to the main directory from State/ by something
  and this requires import.h to be present in both places. It would
  be worthwhile to simplify whatever the heck is going on there.
