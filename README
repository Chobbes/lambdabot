INSTALL:

First install hs-plugins and fps.
    darcs get http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~dons/code/fps
    darcs get http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~dons/code/hs-plugins

Begin by unpacking the lambdabot archive into a directory and modify the
file Config.hs to suit your needs. Then run:

	autoconf
	./configure
	make	(gmake on some systems)

For compiling with profiling on, or to compile a static binary
(obviating the need for hs-plugins!), try

    make way=p
or
    make way=static
