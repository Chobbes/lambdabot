INSTALL:

You'll need GHC >= 6.4.

If your Cabal isn't recent (i.e. it's only 1.0) then bulid a newer
Cabal (instructions in the Cabal README file), which lives at:
        $ darcs get http://cvs.haskell.org/darcs/cabal

Build the FastPackedString library:
        $ darcs get --partial http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~dons/code/fps
        $ cd fps
        $ ln -s fps.cabal.no-mmap fps.cabal
        $ runhaskell Setup.hs configure --prefix=/home/dons
        $ runhaskell Setup.hs build
        $ runhaskell Setup.hs install

And then build lambdabot:
        $ cd ..
        $ darcs get --partial http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~dons/code/lambdabot
        $ cd lambdabot/
        $ autoconf
        $ ./configure
        -- edit Config.hs to your requirements
        $ make          # you could try -j2
        $ ./lambdabot

Optionally, for the Haskell eval plugin to work, you need to also
install hs-plugins: http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~dons/hs-plugins
Build instructions for hs-plugins below.

After this, you'll notice some of the plugins don't seem to work. They
require extra local files. @yow needs a fortune file directory and @code needs 
fptools. You can provide paths to these files in the Config.hs module,
or just live with those plugins not working.

Plugins are added or removed config.mk and removing them from the list
of PLUGINS.

For compiling with profiling on:

    make way=p

To compile a dynamic version, with reloadable plugins.
Build hs-plugins:
        $ cd ..
        $ darcs get --partial http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~dons/code/hs-plugins
        $ cd hs-plugins/
        $ chmod +x Setup.lhs configure
        $ ./Setup.lhs configure --prefix=/usr/local
        $ ./Setup.lhs build
        $ ./Setup.lhs install

    Then
        $ make dynamic=yes

To build really quickly, for testing:

    make way=fast

For cleaning, use:
    make clean
or
    make distclean

to clean the tree.

CONNECTING:
    ./lambdabot --online

OFFLINE MODE:
    ./lambdabot

SCRIPTS:

    They are self-explanatory
