INSTALL:

You'll need GHC >= 6.4

Build the Data.ByteString library at http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~dons,
version 0.7 and later are ok.

Build with cabal:
    $ chmod +x Setup.hs configure
    $ ./Setup.hs configure 
    -- edit Config.hs to your requirements
    $ ./Setup.hs build
    $ ./dist/build/lambdabot

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Optionally, for the Haskell eval plugin to work, you need to also
install hs-plugins: http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~dons/hs-plugins
Build instructions for hs-plugins below.

After this, you'll notice some of the plugins don't seem to work. They
require extra local files. @yow needs a fortune file directory and @code needs 
fptools. You can provide paths to these files in the Config.hs module,
or just live with those plugins not working.

Plugins are added or removed config.mk and removing them from the list
of PLUGINS.

You can also build with GNU make, which is currently more flexible:
    $ cd lambdabot/
    $ autoconf
    $ ./configure
    -- edit Config.hs to your requirements
    $ make
    $ ./lambdabot

For compiling with profiling on:

    make way=p

To compile a dynamic version, with reloadable plugins.
Build hs-plugins:
        $ cd ..
        $ darcs get --partial http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~dons/code/hs-plugins
        $ cd hs-plugins/
        $ chmod +x Setup.lhs configure
        $ ./Setup.lhs configure --prefix=/usr/local
        $ ./Setup.lhs build
        $ ./Setup.lhs install

    Then
        $ make dynamic=yes

To build really quickly, for testing:

    make way=fast

For cleaning, use:
    make clean
or
    make distclean

to clean the tree.

CONNECTING:
    ./lambdabot --online

OFFLINE MODE:
    ./lambdabot

SCRIPTS:
    The scripts directory contains some shell scripts for Vim editor support
    They are self-explanatory
