INSTALL:

You'll need GHC >= 6.5 (for example ghc 20050806 seems to work well) for the @eval plugin to work.

Build the FastPackedString library:

        $ darcs get --partial http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~dons/code/fps
        $ cd fps
        $ ln -s fps.cabal.no-mmap fps.cabal
        $ runhaskell Setup.hs configure --prefix=/home/dons
        $ runhaskell Setup.hs build
        $ runhaskell Setup.hs install

Build hs-plugins:

        $ cd ..
        $ darcs get --partial http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~dons/code/hs-plugins
        $ cd hs-plugins/
        $ runhaskell Setup.hs configure --prefix=/home/dons
        $ runhaskell Setup.hs build
        $ runhaskell Setup.hs install

Build Lambdabot:

        $ cd ..
        $ darcs get --partial http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~dons/code/lambdabot
        $ cd lambdabot/
        $ autoconf
        $ ./configure
        -- edit Config.hs to your requirements
        $ make
        $ ./lambdabot

After this, you'll notice some of the plugins don't seem to work. They
require extra local files. For example, @hoogle needs the 'hoogle'
binary to be installed in the path, @yow needs a fortune file directory,
@code needs fptools. This will be fixed eventually, but for now read the
src of the broken plugin to find out what files it requires.

Plugins are added or removed config.mk and removing them from the list
of PLUGINS.

For compiling with profiling on, or to compile a static binary
(obviating the need for hs-plugins!), try

    make way=p
or
    make static=yes

To build really quickly, for testing:

    make way=fast

For cleaning, use:
    make clean
or
    make distclean

to clean the tree.
