BUILDING:

You'll need GHC >= 6.4

Build the Data.ByteString library at http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~dons,
version 0.7 and later are ok.

Build with cabal (easiest):
    $ vi Config.hs
    $ chmod +x configure
    $ ./Setup.hs configure --bindir=`pwd`
    $ ./Setup.hs build
    $ ./Setup.hs install
    $ ./lambdabot

Or with ghci (fastest turn around)
    $ vi Config.hs
    $ sh configure
    $ sh ghci Main.hs
then
    *Main> main
or
    *Main> online

OFFLINE MODE:
    ./lambdabot

CONNECTING:
    ./lambdabot --online

SCRIPTS:
    The scripts directory contains some shell scripts for Vim editor support
    They are self-explanatory
